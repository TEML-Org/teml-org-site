# The Event Modeling Language Org

## Mission

The Event Modeling Language Org has been established to create a
formalized language for defining an Event Model. Having an agreed upon standard
language for Event Modeling opens opportunities for the design and implementation of tooling for Event Modeling.

## What is Event Modeling?

Event Modeling is method of documenting information flow in a 'system'. The 'system' could be a software program, or a real life system. The Event Modeling method was developed by **Adam Dymitruk**, and the official home page is at [https://eventmodeling.org](https://eventmodeling.org)

## What is the 'Event Modeling Language' and why do we need it?

Event Modeling using graphical tools is a great method for sharing information by drawing a system in a visual way that people can view together and gain understanding. Drawing diagrams, even with today's great diagramming tools can be time consuming and difficult to maintain. For people with accessibility issues, it can be even more difficult.
A standardized textual langage will allow more people to enjoy the benefites of Event Modeling and will allow for a common intermediate language that can be used to generate documents and code.

A standardized textual language has advantages including:

- Better accessibility for people with hand limitations.
- Better accessibility for screen readers.
- Possible faster input using text only.
- Plain text format will allow use of standard version control such as Git.
- Input to, or output from automated tooling.
