# **The Event Modeling Language (TEML)**

**TEML** stands for **The Event Modeling Language**. It is a textual specification designed to make documenting and modeling systems more accessible and efficient. TEML is based on **YAML**, which makes it both fast to write and simple to read.

TEML can be used in two key ways:

1. **Pseudo-Code Style**: Quickly get ideas out of your head and onto paper or into a text editor.
2. **Compliant Format**: Refine it into a structured version for:
   - Feeding into processors to generate code.
   - Outputting models from existing code using specialized tools.

TEML is an open-source project, and its repository can be found here: [TEML-Org GitHub](https://github.com/TEML-Org/teml-org-site).

## **What is Event Modeling?**

**Event Modeling** is a method of documenting information flow within a **system**. The "system" could refer to:

- A software application.
- A real-world process or system.

The method was developed by **Adam Dymitruk**, and the official homepage for Event Modeling is [eventmodeling.org](https://eventmodeling.org).

## **What is TEML and Why Do We Need It?**

Graphical tools for Event Modeling are effective for visually sharing and understanding systems. However, they can present challenges such as:

- Time-consuming creation and maintenance.
- Accessibility difficulties for people with disabilities.

**TEML** solves these challenges by providing a **standardized textual language** that offers:

- Improved **accessibility** for people with physical limitations or screen reader requirements.
- Faster input via plain text.
- Support for **version control systems** like Git (due to its plain text format).
- Compatibility with **automated tools** for generating documents and code.

**Advantages of TEML**:

- Better accessibility for individuals with hand limitations.
- Enhanced compatibility with screen readers.
- Faster input through text-only approaches.
- Use of plain text for easier version control.
- Integration with tooling for input and output processes.

## **Mission of TEML Org**

The **Event Modeling Language Org** exists to:

- Create a formalized textual language for defining an **Event Model**.
- Develop and promote an **agreed-upon standard** for Event Modeling.
- Enable the design and implementation of **tools** for Event Modeling.

By providing this standardized language, TEML aims to give users an additional way to:

1. Document and model systems effectively.
2. Accelerate the development and maintenance of Event Models.
