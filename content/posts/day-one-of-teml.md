Today is 2024-12-29. I decided that no one was going to come around and give me permission to standardize a textual language for the event moddeling process, and I could wait forevery for someone else to do it. I think that means I should just get started.

I've started this website. I've created a new organization on Github with a repo for my documentation notes.

The project will be open source under the Apache 2.0 License. I would love some help with this, but I also would love it to say so simple that it doesn't require much work.

If you have any experience defining a language spec I'd love some advice and help.

If you think you have something to contribute, please submit a PR to the repo.

Anyway, this is how the project started today.
