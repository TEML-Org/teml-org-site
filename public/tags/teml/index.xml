I decided that no one was going to come around and give me permission to standardize a textual language for the event moddeling process, and I could wait forevery for someone else to do it. I think that means I should just get started.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve started this website. I&amp;rsquo;ve created a new organization on Github with a repo for my documentation notes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The project will be open source under the Apache 2.0 License. I would love some help with this, but I also would love it to say so simple that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t require much work.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
